Final Project Report
In this certain code for this project it is about creating a shapefile for the given data.
The main parts of the code are to create a toolbox which includes 3 main parts. The Input, Output, and Workspace.
To use the code you need a input file (JSON) then you need to name the output and finally select the workspace. AFter doing this you should be able to run the script.
The code was developed using techniques we've learned throughout the semester.
